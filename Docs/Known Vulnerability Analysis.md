# Known Vulnerability Analysis


Dependency-Track integrates with multiple sources of vulnerability intelligence to identify components with known
vulnerabilities. The platform employs several methods of vulnerability identification including:

## Internal

Identifies vulnerable components from an internal directory of vulnerable software. The internal analyzer relies on a dictionary of vulnerable software. This dictionary is automatically populated when NVD, GitHub Advisories, or VulnDB mirroring is performed. The internal analyzer is applicable to all components with valid CPEs, including application, operating system, and hardware components, and all components with Package URLs.


## OSS Index

OSS Index is a service provided by Sonatype which identifies vulnerabilities in third-party components. OSS Index is a service provided by Sonatype which identifies vulnerabilities in third-party components. The service supports a wide range of package management ecosystems. Dependency-Track integrates natively with OSS Index to provide highly accurate results. This analyzer is applicable to all components with valid Package URLs.

Refer to VulnDB (Datasource) for additional information.
## VulnDB

VulnDB is a commercial service which identifies vulnerabilities in third-party components

### VulnDB Mirror Setup

- Download the standalone VulnDB Data Mirror tool
- Execute the tool and specify the Dependency-Track vulndb directory as the target
- Dependency-Track will automatically sync the contents of the vulndb directory every 24 hours (and on startup)

Example

```
vulndb-data-mirror.sh \
    --consumer-key mykey \
    --consumer-secret mysecret \
    --dir "~/.dependency-track/vulndb"
```

Each of the analyzers above can be enabled or disabled independently from one another.
