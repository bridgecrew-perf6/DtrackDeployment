# DefectDojo Integration

Dependency-Track can automatically publish results to DefectDojo providing a consolidated view of security-centric code findings and vulnerable component findings.

## Configuration

Step 1: Create a product (or navigate to one youâ€™ve created already
Step 2: Create a CI/CD engagement for your product
Step 3: Note down the ID of the new engagement
Step 4: Note down your API key
Step 5: Add the API key in Dependency-Track configuration

### Per-project configuration

Dependency-Track includes the ability to specify configuration properties on a per-project basis. This feature is used to map projects in Dependency-Track to engagements in DefectDojo.
